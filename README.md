Here are some of the program's features:

## Simultaneous right and left click on links
This way you can quickly open links without opening the right-click menu and clicking Open in new tab there.

If the cursor is on a link, then if you first press and hold the <kbd>right mouse button</kbd>, then the <kbd>left mouse button</kbd>, it will load the page in a new inactive tab (you can go to the tab later). <br>Conversely, if you first press and hold the <kbd>left mouse button</kbd>, then the <kbd>right mouse button</kbd>, it will load the page in a new tab, and go there.

## Move and Resize window by clicking anywhere in the window (AltDrag alternative)
This allows you to **move the window by any place** (not only by the Titlebar). **Resize by clicking near the edge** of the window (not necessarily exactly on the border itself). Align windows on a line, stick to other windows, and the middle of the screen. <br>Simultaneous pressing of the <kbd>left</kbd> and <kbd>right</kbd> mouse buttons, turns on the <kbd>window moving mode</kbd>, or <kbd>window resizing</kbd>. Then, if only the <kbd>left</kbd> button is held down, then this moves the window. If only the <kbd>right</kbd> button is held down, then this changes the window size. 

If hold down <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while moving, the window will move straight, vertically, or horizontally. By holding down only <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and releasing the <kbd>left</kbd> mouse button, you can move the window again by pressing the <kbd>left</kbd> mouse button. 

If <kbd>LShift</kbd> is held down, the window will snap to the edges of the screen, to the middle of the screen, and to the edges of windows. If hold down <kbd>LShift</kbd>, you can release the <kbd>left mouse button</kbd>, and move the window by another place again, by holding down left mouse button. 

When the window is in resize mode, the following hotkeys exist:<br>If you click in the middle of the window, it centers the window in the <kbd>middle of the screen</kbd>, and changes the size on both sides, left and right. 

If you roll the <kbd>wheel down</kbd> (holding the right mouse button), the window expands to full screen height. If you roll the <kbd>wheel down</kbd> again, it restores the window to its previous size. <br>Same thing for width. If you turn the <kbd>wheel up</kbd>, the window expands to the full width of the screen. If you turn the <kbd>wheel up</kbd> again, it returns to its previous size.<br>
><b>Note!</b> This does not work if the cursor is on the link. Instead, when you click the <kbd>left</kbd> and <kbd>right</kbd> mouse buttons at the same time, it assigns - <kbd>Open link in a new inactive tab</kbd>, or in a <kbd>new active tab</kbd>. Depending on what was clicked first
